# DMTools

This is a tool I am developing to help organize DM Notes, keep track of stuff in combat, keep track of rolling information, player sheets, and much more. I have a large dream of this being a supplementary tool to run  
a DND (or other TTRPG system, possibly) out of, while using Roll20, in-person, or another VTT side-by-side. I hope this helps, and this is a work in progress currently. It is being developed for Windows 10+,  
and hopefully I can develop for Linux/Unix/MacOS in the future.

## Ideas

If you have ideas for features we can add, please feel free to create an issue and some in-depth explanation for the feature.

## Current ideas in the works:

* Encounter generator
* Name generator
* DM Script tracker
* Enounter (both non-combat and combat) tracker

## JSON format

I plan to use a JSON format for all file uploads (including (N)PC stat block, monster stat block, and other things. Or, an option to create those stat blocks too, in app.

Currently, monster stat blocks can be grabbed from [here](https://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html?fbclid=IwAR1jLdPi9P3Srhqu4_luQ6a-5wkmA_NFlBkO0ERcUwxHDXe7f17rrxbh7Po), a great tool for creating stat blocks.

## Encounter generator

The idea is to base off of [this site](https://koboldplus.club/#/encounter-builder), but house it in app, and make it dynamic (i.e. your silly party wanders into an area you haven't prepped for yet).  
The non-combat generator should be able to take in a setting (i.e., night in the forest), and out put a full encounter.  
Example: The player on watch hears a beautiful song in the distance. The archfey Titania is singing in the woods, in a circle of mushrooms, a distance away. SHe asks the player, as they approach "Can I have your name?"

And so on.
